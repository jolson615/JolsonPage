				<h1>A Word on Hipsterism</h1>
				<p>I grew up in Nashville, and it's bit of a wacky place--a sort of incubator for metrosexuality, musical ability, and coffee connoisseurship. Of course, as a Nashville native, the thought that this might be somewhat misrepresentative of the American populous as a whole never crossed my mind. I just assumed that everyone lived next door to famous country singers, knew a few producers, and had toured a recording studio at least once. In fact, the idea that anyone ever wanted to be anything other than a musician never crossed my mind. It seemed only natural that everyone was born wanting to be a rock star, and it was only after a few years of heartbreak in the form of botched auditions and jazz club gigs that those without talent settled for lesser jobs like "doctor" or "lawyer" or "president". </p>
				<p>Fast forward a few years to when I first heard the word. It seems like I had only barely set foot on campus when a massive upperclassman bro in a bright blue fishing shirt saw me and snorted under his breath, "friggin' hipster." </p>
				<p>"Hipster"</p>
				<p>The word was dripping with disdain--a venomous dart aimed straight at my skinny jeans. And poor innocent college-freshman me was all but dumbstruck. I was indie. What's this hipster business?</p>

				</figure>
				<p>I learned quickly. "Hipster" was no compliment. The word originated back in the 1940s to refer to someone who adopted the lifestyle of a jazz musician. A hipster dressed according to the trends of the day, used the flash-bang slang of the "right then", and smothered his sincerity in layers of sarcasm. 1940s hipsters looked toward the future, and once the old, white men of the day like Lawrence Welk adopted the same trends, the hipsters would dutifully turn their attention even further forward. Once a trend went mainstream, it was time to find something new. </p>
				<p>But after 70 years of saying "you're predictable and boring" to anything popular, hipsters have earned a "right back at you" from popular culture. When said with such loathing in 2015, "hipster" means you are a walking oxymoron--someone who, in an attempt to set him or herself apart from the masses, ends up looking like a cookie cutter version of everyone else trying to look unique. A hipster tries so hard to stand out that he or she ends up utterly indistinguishable from anyone else trying for that same thing. They're all a bunch of Fleet-Foxes-listening, Toms-wearing, self-important posers.</p>
				<p>But here's the thing: I never set out to be unique... or to fit in.</p> 
				<p> My hipsterism is a natural outpouring of my musical sensibilities. My heart beats in time with the blogosphere, and when I find a song I like, I listen to it--whether that means I am listening to Animal Collective or Avril Lavigne, Hot Chip or Hillary Duff.</p>
				<p>The same goes for clothes--sure I had some Target-brand Ray-Bands, a pair of corduroy Toms, and a closet full of neon T-shirts long before neon was a thing, but I didn't do it to look unique. Heck, everyone else in Nashville looked the same way. I did it because I didn't know there were other clothing options. By the time I learned that people actually wear Hollister (instead of just mocking it), it was too late. I was set in my ways. </p>
				<figure><img src="./images/cartoons/Hipster.jpg"><figcaption>-- We even shop ironically</figcaption></figure>
				<p>Here's the thing about hipsters: a true hipster will never admit to being one. It has become an inherently negative word. I don't claim credit for that observation; it's a common adage. Call a hipster just that and he'll bristle at the notion: "No way man. Really? You really think I'm a hipster?" all said while he doodles in his Moleskine, adjusts his horn-rimmed glasses, and sips on a local brew of coffee.  His clueless act fools no one.</p>
				<p>This realization marked an epiphany for me. All I had to do was own the label! If someone calls me a hipster, she's pointing out three key things--she thinks I have great music tastes, she thinks I dress well, and she thinks I'm a self-important prick. To take that insult with a smile, all I have to do is focus on the first two parts of what she means and be as friendly as possible until she realize that tripartite definition is, in my case, only two-thirds true.</p>
				<p>With that epiphany came a whole new way of making friends. Now, I wear the label "hipster" proudly--a plaid badge of courage, if you will--proof that I can take a stereotype and confound it. </p>
				<p>So to someone too concerned with appearances to see the human inside this hipster, I say that's fine. We'd probably have a hard time seeing eye-to-eye on a lot of things. </p>
				<p>Especially your frat-monogrammed fishing shirt.</p>

				<h1>A Timeline</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>May, 2007 - Graduated from Brentwood Academy with a bucket of AP credits and virtually no understanding of how privileged I was.</li>
					<li>August, 2007 - Entered Baylor University with a major in University Scholars, which is what Baylor calls undecided if your PSAT scores are high enough</li>
					<li>2008-2009 - Studied at Hoesei University in Tokyo for 11 months where I took Japanese and Spanish classes</li>
					<li>2011 - Graduated from Baylor with a major in University Scholars and an epmhasis in Neuroscience and contemporary American literature; worked as Special Assistant to Judge Ken Starr, President of Baylor University</li>
					<li>2012 - Moved to Phoenix as a TFA Corps Member in English, passionate about being a responsible steward of my privilege as a teacher at Agua Fria High School and equally passionate about my craft as a writer and an analytical thinker.</li>
					<li>2014 - Completed my M.Ed. at Arizona State University in Secondary English Education</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>I Know The List Looks Pretentious</h1>
				<p>Even though all that stuff over there is true, I haven't found a way to mention it all that communicates the intersection of passion and humility I feel about it all.</p>
				<p>On the one hand, mentioning moments like studying abroad in Japan feels like I'm proud of simply being privileged enough to have had that opportunity. I understand that spending 11 months practicing Japanese grammar is really a luxury - not an accomplishment. But in all honesty, it feels weird to try to present myself without clarifying who I am with details like "studied abroad in Japan" because they are such an integral part of my history. So when I clog up casual conversations with stories of the time I worked for Ken Starr or about walking through my favorite park in Japan, I'm not trying to make sure everyone in the room remembers what I've "accomplished" - it's just that those events consumed entire years of my life. If I tried to avoid mentioning those experiences in conversation, then that conversation would be stilted and fake.</p>
				<p>So that's why I buried the resume half of this bio under an essay on skinny jeans and headphones. I love learning. I love thinking carefully - about English, about Algebra, about Code, about social justice - and I like to think that my voice and my thoughts matter more than my resume.</p>

				<h1>Door-to-door</h1>
				<p>In the summers of 2013 and 2014, I sold educational books door-to-door.</p>
				<p>Yes.</p>
				<p>I'm that guy.</p>
				<p>If it's done correctly, it's actually awesome. Sure, as a salesman working 80-hour weeks, you learn a ton about preseverence, positivity, optimism, and humility, and you hone your interpersonal communication skills on a whole other level. But more importantly, you get to get up close and personal with the lives of families from all socioeconomic levels, and you get to witness some pretty amazing parenting. </p>
				<p>Ask me to tell you about it sometime.</p>
