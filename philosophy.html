				<h1>Teach Well; Love Well</h1>
				<p>When I first set out to teach, I assumed all that needed to change in education was some slight tweaking of the curriculum. If we read <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> instead of <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>, the kids would like English class and the day would be saved. And if there were especially jaded kids, all it took was a cool teacher who could see past their tough exterior and find relevant materials</p>
				<p>It sounds hilarious in retrospect. I think I intended to roll in like Robin Williams, aware of the talents of BOTH Tupac and Steinbeck, and that'd be enough.</p>
				<p>I was wrong on so many levels, and I'm still learning, but over time, I've learned a few things that I believe to be true.</p>
				<h2>1. Learning is the result of DISCOVERY, not instruction.</h2>
				<p>I might not have figured this out if I had started in math, because you can sequence a skill into steps, and then teach those steps. Students can fake buckets of knowledge if only they know the steps. And teachers are great at teaching steps. And then when a student fails to follow the steps, the teacher can blame the student: "I broke it down into the simplest steps possible - if you can't follow the steps, you're just failing to follow directions."</p>
				<p>But in English, listing the steps to a skill like, say, identifying allusion brings to light how far away steps can be from geniune understanding. What steps would I even teach?</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Become familiar with the entire Bible, all of Greek mythology, and every novel written prior to the piece you are reading.</li>
					<li>Look for names or ideas that were mentioned before in those other works.</li>
					<li>Write a profound explanation that examines why that allusion contributes to the purpose of the piece you are reading.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Put like that, the inanity becomes clear.</p>
				<p>I've come to believe pretty firmly that steps equate to fake knowledge unless the kids discover and record those steps all on their own.</p>
				<p>The brilliant part is that sometimes, the kiddos turn those steps into simpler methods than the ones I was taught. This week, we learned completing the square, and a student (who by standardized scores would be considered bottom of the pack because he works slowly and gives up quickly) came up with a brilliant extra step that simplified it for five of his peers that weren't getting it. If I had laid out precise steps as the gospel of completing the square as taught by Khan Academy, those five students would still be lost.</p>
				<h2>2. We don't ADD fun to content; we FIND the fun that's there.</h2>
				<p>Somewhere along the way, someone threw the word "real-world" into the math standards, and all of a sudden, the problem about two trains meeting in Columbus was born. The idea is that students would stop asking "when am I ever gonna use this in real life?" because the application is obvious.</p>
				<p>You'll use this when you want to know when your train will get to Columbus.</p>
				<p>The hilarity here should be apparent, but in case it's been a while since you've spent time with the TEENZ in Phoenix, let me assure you that they don't take trains, they don't plan to EVER go to Columbus, and if they get there 20 minutes before their friends, they'll just get a Starbucks and text the ones whose train ran late.</p>
				<p>So we try to tweak the problem by switching it to two lines at a Lil' Wayne concert and we raise the stakes by insisting that only one line will get to the window before the tickets sell out, but the problem is that at the end of the day, you've not taught them to love math - you've lied to them by creating a world wherein math and Lil' Wayne are somehow related.</p>
				<p>We think that if we throw in words like "Starbucks" and "Instagram", we've made our material more culturally relevant, but I would like to submit that when we name-drop elements of pop culture to get our kids' attention, we're actually just conceding that content without culture is boring--that without Weezy, math is lame.</p>
				<p>Even in the best-case scenario where your students are engaged that day, these kids still don't like math - they just like the way you teach it. What happens next year when they move on and you aren't their math teacher anymore?</p>
				<p>Not only have you failed to show how cool math can be; you've also alienated every kid there who doesn't care about Lil' Wayne/Drake/Kenrick/Whoever the culturally figure du jour is.</p>
				<p>The same is true in English - you don't invest kids in your content by rapping all the words in a Shakespeare sonnet. That's contrived, and it insists that the content is only fun when wrapped around whatever they already like.</p>
				<p>Students don't ask "When am I ever going to use this in real life?" because they don't see the relevance of your content. They ask that question because they are bored and confused. If they're feeling successful, that feeling of success is reason enough to keep going.</p>
				<p>That's why we play the function game whenever I teach a new concept, and my students just get to guess numbers to input into a function. Then, I tell them what number comes out. You'd be amazed at how hard the kids will work to figure out the patterns for the sole reason that there aren't any wrong guesses at this point in the lesson. There aren't a series of sequenced steps. They love coloring outside the lines on their graphing paper, so to speak.</p>
				<p>Think about your own passions:</p>
				<p>If you like math, it's probably because you learned faster than the teacher taught and discovered patterns on your own.</p>
				<p>If you like reading, it's probably because you found a way to connect with and invest in characters <em>before</em> the teacher told you that "the green light symbolizes greed and lust," because really, who cares about the green light when you really couldn't care whether Gatsby or Daisy live to see the dawn.</p>
				<p>If you like writing, it's probably because you were told somewhere along the way that you're good at it, and that the ideas in your head are worth writing down.</p>
				<p>What I'm getting at here is that there's fun in proficiency. We REALLY like being good at stuff--and not just being told we're doing well, but actually being good at any given task.</p>
				<h2>3. Learning = failure + tenacity</h2>
				<p>This one's actually already been hit pretty hard on everything from Sesame Street to stand-up comedy, and it's almost the converse of the above. Webcomic Doodle Alley wrote a <a href="http://doodlealley.com/2012/10/10/be-friends-with-failure/">brillant take</a> on this whole idea, and I cannot reccomend it highly enough.</p>
				<P>TLDR: When we first attempt to do anything, we almost invariably suck at it, and it's only through ignorance to our own suckiness that we persevere and eventually stop sucking so badly.</P>
				<p>But the problem is that as teachers, sometimes we forget to preserve that ignorance as we "offer feedback".</p>
				<p>If we really believe failure is the gateway to success, then we need to celebrate the effort behind failure - not because it's an acceptable destinantion, but because it's a necessary step along the way. When a student raises his hand in earnestness, we need to celebrate his willingness to be vulnerable in front of the group, and his tencity in applying some measure of logical thought to the problem, even if his logic is misguided.</p>
				<p>I've been that hypercritical teacher whose students are so aware of their own shortcomings thanks to my feedback that they dare not raise their hands. It's humbling to realize that their terrified silence is my fault, and I'm getting better every day at not just saying that I reward failure as a step toward success, but actually doing it.</p>
				<h2>4. Love honestly, and love well</h2>
				<p>One time, a professional development speaker said to our entire district, "You don't have to like every kid, you just have to get them to think that you like them."</p>
				<p>I was furious.</p>
				<p>Because honestly, I disagree with him on a fundamental level. I think that at its core, teaching must be rooted in love. For one, because we don't get paid enough to do this job for any other reason, but more importantly, because many of our kids need love more than they need algebra.</p>
				<p>Rather fittingly, on that same day, my roommate had a professional development speaker at her school who said, "Kids who get love at school come to school to learn. Kids who don't get love at home come to school to get love, and then to learn."</p>
				<p>Perhaps this is more obvious at an elementary school, where kids are forthcoming about the fact that they haven't eaten since they came home from school the previous day. By high school, they learn to be ashamed of that fact, so they hide it. But I have one of those kids too (we'll call him Collie), and it took me 3 months to figure out that the reason he only has lunch on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. He needed 30 cents to buy the school's lunch, and he only sees his grandma on Sundays. By Thursday, her gift to him would run out.</p>
				<p>Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if he's disruptive in my class. He deserves to eat, and that shouldn't hinge on whether or not I like him.</p>
				<p>So it's not about fake-liking a student. They can smell fake from a mile away, and they'd honestly prefer you just hated them outright. It's about finding something - some sliver of their person or personality - that you genuinely appreciate. Once you have that one focal point (his kindness when tutoring, her passion for singing, his leadership on the football field), choose to see that first, and then to take everything else through that filter.</p>
				<p>Loving your students is a necessity, liking them is a choice, and once those two things are out of the way, getting to know them is a joy.</p>
